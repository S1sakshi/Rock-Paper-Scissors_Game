# Rock-Paper-Scissors_Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows a user to play against the computer, which randomly selects its move.

•  **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can select rock, paper, or scissors using buttons on a web page.

•  **Computer Opponent**: The computer randomly selects a move each turn.

•  **Dynamic Results**: The game announces the winner (player or computer) or if it's a draw.

•  **Simple UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface built with HTML and styled with CSS.
